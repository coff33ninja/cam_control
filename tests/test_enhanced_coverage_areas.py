Test script for enhanced coverage area visualization functionality.

This script tests the enhanced coverage area implementation for task 7:
- Enhanced coverage area visualization with detailed styling and tooltips
- Different coverage shapes (circular vs directional) based on camera type
- Coverage area styling with opacity changes based on connectivity status
- Hover effects and tooltips for coverage areas showing camera details
